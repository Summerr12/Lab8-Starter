In your README.md, please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)

Graceful degradation is the idea that we prioritize the functionality of the web application even when on a weaker device or device that is not as supported. Service workers is the idea to prioitize the functionality of the web application even when there is no internet or they are offline. Both are similar because they strive to protect user experience and accessibility for any user.
